      <h1>Babylonian Boxes</h1>
      <h3>Problem ID: stackingboxes</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The people of 2D Babylon have the brilliant idea to build a
    tower to reach heaven. At their disposal they have rectangles
    with varying widths and heights. In order to construct the
    tower, they can stack these rectangles. The only problem is
    they can stack a rectangle on another only if it’s base is
    lesser than or equal to the rectangle directly below it. Due to
    limits on construction infrastructure, the people of Babylon
    cannot change the relative order of the boxes they see. It must
    be taken in the sequence they see it. For example, a rectangle
    that appears earlier in the input cannot be placed above a
    rectangle that appears later in the sequence even if it obeys
    the base rule. One thing they can do however, is rotate the
    rectangle to use the height or width as a base as long as the
    base stacking rule isn’t violated. Given a set of rectangles
    help the people of 2D Babylon build the tallest tower they can.
    There’s no way this is a bad idea, right?</p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>The input consists of one test case. The first line contains
    an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 1000)$</span>, the
    number of rectangles. The following <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains two space separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$(1 \le a, b \le 200)$</span>, the dimensions
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$ith$</span>
    rectangle.</p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>Output a single integer, the tallest tower that can be
    built.</p>
