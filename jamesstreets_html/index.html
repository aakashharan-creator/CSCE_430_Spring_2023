      <h1>James’s Streets</h1>
      <h3>Problem ID: jamesstreets</h3>
    </div>
    <p>James has been invited to an incredibly important, exclusive
    conference at Moc-Yap that is sure to boost his career. Since
    James wouldn’t miss this for the world, he makes the 45 hour
    drive across the country to attend. In order to make it to the
    building where the conference is held, he will have to cross
    the street and there are no designated sidewalks. This is a
    problem as James has a deathly fear of crossing streets without
    sidewalks. The only way he would ever possibly feel comfortable
    crossing the street is if he had at least <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$K$</span> seconds in which there was no car
    crossing as that is the fastest James can cross this street
    according to his calculations. Fortunately, even if a car
    reached James’s path at exactly the <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$Kth$</span> second from when James starts to
    cross the street, or if James starts to cross the street right
    after a car crosses he will be safe. James plans to walk in a
    straight line, perpendicular to the street to minimize his
    distance as well. James also considered waiting until every car
    finished crossing before he started to cross the street, but
    there simply isn’t enough time to wait. If it’s impossible to
    make it on time, he will have to let his manager know of his
    extenuating circumstances, but he needs to do so quickly.</p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>The input consists of one test case. The input starts with a
    pair of integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$100,000$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$50,000$</span>. <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$N$</span> indicates the number of cars on
    the road and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> indicates
    the amount of time in seconds James requires to cross the
    street. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers
    follow, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, c_2, c_3, \dots
    c_N$</span>, each between <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$-1,000,000$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$1,000,000$</span>, indicating the time,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|c_i|$</span>, that car
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_i$</span> takes to reach the
    path James is crossing. Each car has a negligible length in
    this scenario. A negative time indicates a car coming from the
    left, and a positive number indicates a car coming from the
    right. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_i = c_j$</span>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \ne j$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_i$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$c_j$</span> can be treated as one car.</p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>Output the string "YES" if James can cross the street or
    "IMPOSSIBLE" if James cannot cross the street.</p>
